Fixed recovery vault encryption, created database endpoint.

## Obstakels
* Recovery Vault wouldn't launch due to customer-managed key for encryption.
* Database private endpoint FQDN was the same as public endpoint.

## Oplossingen
* Realised encryption was baked-in by default, removed CMK.
* Found naming conventions for private endpoints and their related services, which were tied to the FQDN.

## Learnings
Documentation is good.
