## Dagverslag (1 zin)
Launched App Gateway with HTTP to HTTPS redirection, found a janky solution for SSL certificate.

## Obstakels
Including SSL certificates in Bicep is difficult.

## Oplossingen
Found a janky short-term solution that should satisfy project requirements. Far from best or even functional practice for proper SSL encryption.

## Learnings
Good to get everything working before laser-focusing on a difficult issue like the SSL certificate.
