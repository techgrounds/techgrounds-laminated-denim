### Repositories
* Project folder that contains all files and version (revision) histories. Can use it alone or invite people to work with you.
* Multiple repositories possible. One per project?
* Add a *readme* to explain the project and how to use it.

### Cloning
* Creates a local copy on your PC. You can use git to sync this with the cloud.
* Pulls down all repository data: all versions of every file and folder.

### Comitting and pushing
* The way you adapt changes made locally to the GitHub repository.
* You make a commit when you've made changes you want to save.
* Add a commit message to let teammates know what changes you've made.
* Once you've got a commit or commits, use *push* to add the changes to the repository.

### Branches
* To separate work you don't want merged into the final project yet.
* For new features, bugfixes and experimentation in a contained area.
* Typically branch off the main repository: this creates a copy for experimentation.
* When happy with the changes, merge them into main.

### Forks
* Copy of a repository, but used to contribute to someone else's project.
* Allows free experimentation without affecting the original project.
* Popular with open source.

### Pulls
* Pulls are used to request feedback from collaborators on changes in a branch.
* Add specific people to show them you want their feedback.
* 
### Merge
* Process of adding changes into your main github repository.
