# Key terms
##### Metacognition
Metacognition is the process of understanding one's thoughts and patterns.

# Peer learning
* Explaining concepts to others helps you learn and can show you gaps in your own knowledge.
* Builds cohesion and social relationships.
* Peer support in a classroom environment should look like the following:
	* They help in forming the right questions to ask.
	* They provide direction, but not a complete answer.
	* They share insights they have regarding the material.
* Peer review can offer insight into new techniques and different perspectives.

# Effective Studying
* Plan for assignments to take longer than you think they'll need.
* Give yourself a buffer to review material before an exam.
* Metacognition determines how you see your performance and intelligence in relation to your actual knowledge of the material. Similar to dunning-kruger.
* The brain learns in two different ways: focused and diffused mode. Alternating between these two modes, especially upon getting stuck, can solve problems more quickly than just grinding out the time studying.
	* Focused mode involves concentrating on the material at hand.
	* Diffused mode is a relaxed state of mind. Lying on the couch, taking a walk, taking a nap, etc.
* 

# Goal-setting
* Set concrete goals that are important on a personal level.
* Ask yourself the following questions to determine what kind of goals you might want to set:
	* What do I want to learn?
	* Why do I want to learn this? What do I want to achieve by learning this?
	* What information do I need to accomplish this?
	* What's the best way to get this information?
	

# Resources
* Finding a mentor or expert in the field can be extremely useful.
* Curating a list of quality resources to pull information from can save time googling in the future.

# Reflection
* Using your newfound knowledge in a practical manner allows you to solidify the information and test your skills.
* Reflecting on your learning process can help you identify areas where you can improve or change strategies. Sample questions to ask yourself include:
	* What did you learn this week?
	* Did you show up each day prepared? How did you prepare?
	* What resources did you find that you can use in the future to learn new material?
	* What actions did you take that helped you learn? Why?
	* Can you teach something you've learned to someone else? Why, why not?
	* Are you satisfied with what you've learned?
	* Did you help or hinder your peers?
