* Identify several other protocols and their associated OSI layer. Name at least one for each layer.
	* I read ahead before starting work on the NTW-01 assignment and decided to research and note relevant protocols while reading about the OSI and TCP/IP models.
* Figure out who determines what protocols we use and what is needed to introduce your own protocol.
	* I will use google to find the relevant authority and then read about the process on their website.
* Look into wireshark and install this program. Try and capture a bit of your own network data. Search for a protocol you know and try to understand how it functions.
	* I will install wireshark and experiment with its functions before diving into the documentation to build a broader understanding of the program.

#### IETF
The Internet Engineering Task Force was founded in 1986 and is responsible for the development of new standards and protocols used for the internet, networks and relevant devices.

#### IETF Standards Process
The IETF standards process mandates how a new standard is created and adopted. In essence, it is the development of a new specification that is then iterated upon by the wider internet community. Upon a sufficient amount of iteration that proves its feasibility, it is then adopted as a Standard.

The key benchmarks a Standard needs to achieve adoption include:
* Technical distinction
* A history of implementation and sufficient testing
* Qualitative documentation
* An open, fair and timely nature

#### RFCs
A request for comment; a document that contains technical specifications and notes on a topic related to the IETF. These typically begin their life as internet drafts created by an individual or smal group and become RFCs upon wider adoption.

#### Wireshark
Wireshark is a program that analyses network protocols. It can snoop on packets on a network connection. Common uses include troubleshooting network issues, analysing vulnerabilities and debugging.
