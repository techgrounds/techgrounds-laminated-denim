#### Study:
* IP addresses
* IPv4 and IPv6
* Public and private IPs
* NAT
* Static and dynamic addresses  
I have a layman's knowledge of the above, so to solve the above I need to:
* Find useful, informative sources.
* Transcribe the information into my own words.

#### IP addresses
Internet Protocol addresses are a number that identify a device on a network. In the [32-bit](NTW-04_report_binaryhex.md) IPv4 protocol, hey are typically written in the following format: `255.255.255.255`. In the 128-bit IPv6 protocol, addresses are written using hexadecimal, like so: `2001:0db8:84a3:0000:0000:8a2d:0350:6333`

#### IPv4
Internet Protocol version 4 has been superseded by IPv6, but is still incredibly popular and remains the most widely used protocol. It governs how devices communicate over a network.

#### IPv6

#### Public and private IPs

#### NAT


#### Static and dynamic IPs


#### Exercise:

* Find my PC and mobile's public IP while they're connected to the same network.
	* There are sites that can do this.
		* Are the addresses the same? Why or why not?
			* The knowledge for this answer should be found during study.
* Find my PC and laptop's private IPs.
	* I should be able to find this info on my router.
		* Are the addresses the same? Why or why not?
			* As above, I should find this knowledge during study.
* Change the private IP of my phone to that of my PC and note what happens.
	* I can probably do this on either my router or my phone, and the experimentation should not cost me any extra time compared to searching for the solution.
*  Change the private IP of my phone to a public IP and note what happens.
	* See above.
