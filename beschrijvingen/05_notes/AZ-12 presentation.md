#### Operational Excellence
A practical example of Operational Excellence would be the use of Azure DevOps to make use of continuous integration and deployment tactics. By using Azure Automation, one could automate routine tasks such as resource scaling. With Azure Log Analytics, one could monitor and troubleshoot issues in real-time.

#### Security
One could use Azure Security Center to check whether all resources are compliant with security standards and to detect threats. The implementation of Azure Active Directory to handle identity and access management based on the principle of least privilege would also greatly increase security.

#### Reliability
To ensure availability and resiliency, one could use Azure Traffic Manager to distribute traffic across multiple zones. By implementing Azure Load Balancer, one ensures requests are sent to healthy VM instances. Lastly, one could use Application Insights to monitor application performance.

#### Performance Efficiency
To achieve performance efficiency, one could use Azure CDN to deliver static content more quickly to users. By implementing Azure SQL Database with read replicas, one could achieve high performance access for database retrieval.

#### Cost Optimisation
The use of Azure Advisor to identify and optimise resource usage and Azure Cost Management to monitor costs are key steps for cost optimisation. Continuous review and iteration on the project requirements based on the information these services provide will lead to money saved. Further, one could make use of Azure reserved instances to achieve cost savings.
