#### Azure Storage
Azure offers different manners to store data, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Table Storage. Messaging is handled by Azure Queues and Event Hubs. Loose files can be stored by services such as Azure Files and Azure Blobs. Azure groups Azure Blobs, Azure Files, Azure Queues, and Azure Tables together under the header *Azure Storage.*

#### Storage account
A storage account is a container that groups multiple Storage services together. Only Azure data services can be added to an account.
