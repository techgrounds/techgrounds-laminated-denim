#### Virtual Networks
VNets are the Azure equivalent of a LAN; they provide a private connection between VMs and other services. Subnets, addressing and security are all handled when one sets up a VNet.

#### Network Security Groups
NSGs are software firewalls that can control traffic between subnets or VMs. They allow for full control over every network request entering or exiting a VM.

#### Load Balancer
The Azure Load Balancer can distribute traffic between multiple VMs. 

#### Virtual Machines Scale Sets
Azure vritual machine scale sets allow for the creation of a group of load balanced VMs. These allow scaling on demand or on schedule and provide high availability to applications. Scale sets cost nothing; instead, one pays for the VMs created.
