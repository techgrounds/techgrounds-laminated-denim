#### Virtual Networks
VNets are a set of Azure resources that allow other resources to communicate over a network, with the internet or with on-prem devices. They can also be used to filter traffic using a combination of NSGs, firewalls, gateways, proxies and NAT services.

#### Public IP in Azure
Public IP addresses in Azure are their own resource. They can be associated with a variety of other resources, such as network interfaces or gateways. Public IPs can be static or dynamic in Azure.

#### Network Security Groups
NSGs are software firewalls that can control traffic between subnets or VMs. They allow for full control over every network request entering or exiting a VM.

#### Load Balancer
The Azure Load Balancer can distribute traffic between multiple VMs. 

#### Virtual Machines Scale Sets
Azure virtual machine scale sets allow for the creation of a group of load balanced VMs. These allow scaling on demand or on schedule and provide high availability to applications. Scale sets cost nothing; instead, one pays for the VMs created.
