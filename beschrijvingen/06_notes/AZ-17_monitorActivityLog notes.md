#### [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-monitoring-tools-azure/4-describe-azure-monitor)
Azure Monitor allows one to collect, analyse and visualise data that relates to their resources. It can be used to monitor Azure, on-prem and multi-cloud resources. Using Azure Monitor Alerts, one can automate alerts based on thresholds, but also have it automatically attempt to correct the issue. They can be configured based on log events but also metrics. 

##### Azure Log Analytics
Azure Log Analytics lets one run log queries on data collected by Azure Monitor. This allows one to perform simple queries but also more complex statistical analyses on the data. For example, finding records and using Log Analytics to sort, filter and analyse them.
